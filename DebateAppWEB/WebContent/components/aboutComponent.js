		<h2>Quiblur: Not The Site The Web Deserves, But The Site It Needs Right Now</h2>
		<p>Ladies and gentlemen, trolls and intellectuals, welcome to Quibblur: your outlet for internet outrage. What is Quibblur? We'll let Monte Python explain.</p>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNkjDuSVXiE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>Basically, Quibblur is an argument site, a place where you can find people of opposing views. 
		But Quibblur is more than just a forum for online flame-wars: it's a fully automated moderator, a voting tool, 
		an evidence collector, logic analyzer and a viewer chat room complete with RPG mechanics. Quibblur was built for everyone, from 
		middle-school debate clubs to middle-aged roast masters. You decide the topic, you decide the rules, so you 
		decide what kind of argument you want. Please be respectful (but only if the rules say so), and enjoy!</p>
