# DebateApp
Bringing people together one argument at a time


Quibblur is a project built in Eclipse and Atom using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, AngularJS, REST, Spring, Java, and SQL. The goal of the project was to provide a forum for online arguments and their spectators, allowing viewers to watch and comment on debates in real time. AngularGlue API and Accordian API were used to improve UX. In the future we plan to implement multi-user debates, custom rule sets, and many more features. Known issues include an unclear sign-up page, inactive rule sets, and a placeholder profile page and about page. 

The initial website was created by Johnathon Borgia and Kyle Ennis over 8 days at Skill Distillery coding bootcamp.
